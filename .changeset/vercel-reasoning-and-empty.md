Handle reasoning-model starvation and empty responses in the Vercel adapter.

Reasoning models (Cerebras `gpt-oss-*`, OpenAI o-series, `gpt-5-nano`) often spend their entire output-token budget on hidden reasoning and return an empty visible text when called with a small `maxOutputTokens`. The adapter now detects this (empty text + `finishReason === "length"` + tokens consumed + a caller-supplied budget) and retries once with a 4× budget, mirroring `@llm-ports/adapter-openai`. The retry fires the new `onRetry` hook with `reason: "reasoning-starvation"`. Closes #4.

`generateStructured` previously crashed on the same empty response: `JSON.parse("")` raised `SyntaxError`, which got wrapped as a generic `ProviderUnavailableError` and prevented the registry from making an intelligent fallback decision. The adapter now throws a typed `EmptyResponseError` (from `@llm-ports/core`) carrying `alias` + `modelId` so the registry can route to the next provider in the chain. Closes #5.

Also wires `onRetry` for `validation-feedback` retries in `generateStructured` and adds a new `onRetry?: OnRetry` option to `VercelAdapterOptions`.
