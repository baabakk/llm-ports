Add the `OnRetry` observability hook plus the `RetryEvent` / `RetryReason` types to `@llm-ports/core`. The hook fires whenever an adapter retries an in-flight request for a known transient reason: `transient-auth` (OpenAI project-key burst-protection 401), `capability-fallback` (model rejected temperature, json_object, or system message — drop and retry), `reasoning-starvation` (model spent its full output budget on hidden reasoning; retry with expanded budget), or `validation-feedback` (structured output failed schema; retry with a correction prompt). Called fire-and-forget — hook errors do NOT cancel the retry, and async hooks do NOT block it.

Wires `onRetry` through all four retry sites in `@llm-ports/adapter-openai`: `withTransientAuthRetry` (embeddings), `executeChatRequest`, `executeChatStream`, and the validation-feedback loop inside `generateStructured`. Pass via `createOpenAIAdapter({ apiKey, onRetry })`. Closes #3.

Also adds a typed `EmptyResponseError` to `@llm-ports/core` (used by the Vercel adapter; see the adapter-vercel changeset for #4 / #5).
