# @llm-ports/adapter-anthropic

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- b00ff65: Image-block boundary validation (closes issues #19, #20, #21 from the image-pipeline audit).

  **New errors** in `@llm-ports/core`:
  - `ImageTooLargeError(alias, imageIndex, byteSize, limitBytes)` — base64 image exceeds the provider's per-image byte limit
  - `InvalidImageUrlError(alias, url, reason)` — URL-form image with `file://`, `data:`, missing scheme, or other bad shape

  **New helpers** in `@llm-ports/core`:
  - `validateImageBlocks(blocks, opts)` — call at the adapter boundary on every outgoing `ContentBlock[]`
  - `validateImageUrl(url, alias, allowFileUrl)` — standalone URL-shape check

  **Per-adapter boundary checks** wired in every port method (`generateText`, `generateStructured`, `streamText`, `streamStructured`, `runAgent`) with adapter-specific defaults:

  | Adapter             | Default `imageSizeLimitBytes` | Source                                  |
  | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | `adapter-anthropic` | 5 MB                          | Anthropic's documented per-image limit  |
  | `adapter-openai`    | 20 MB                         | OpenAI's documented per-image limit     |
  | `adapter-ollama`    | unset (model-dependent)       | Ollama itself doesn't enforce           |
  | `adapter-vercel`    | 20 MB                         | Matches the underlying SDK's image path |
  | `adapter-google`    | 20 MB (new package)           | Gemini's documented inline limit        |

  **Assistant `image_url` decoding** in `adapter-openai`: `fromOpenAIAssistantMessage` now decodes any `image_url` content part in an assistant response back to an `ImageBlock` (data URI → base64, http(s) → URL). Previously these were silently dropped (commented "very rare"). Zero models emit this today, but future-proofs the round-trip.

  17 new tests in `@llm-ports/core` + 3 new tests in `@llm-ports/adapter-openai`.

### Patch Changes

- b00ff65: Two-layer validation hardening that reduces retry-with-feedback round-trips:

  **Layer 1 — `extractJSON()` falls back to `jsonrepair`** when plain `JSON.parse` fails. Catches trailing commas, single quotes, smart quotes, unquoted keys, Python `None`/`True`/`False`, comments, missing braces, and most other LLM syntactic quirks before paying for a retry. Gated on "input has `{` or `[`" so prose-only input still throws cleanly.

  **Layer 2 — `attemptValidationRepair()` ported from BEPA** runs between Zod `safeParse` failure and the retry-with-feedback step. Deterministic, schema-driven repair of 6 patterns:
  1. `null` where a non-null type is expected → delete key (lets `.optional()` succeed)
  2. string `"9"` where `number` expected → coerce to `9`
  3. string `"true"`/`"false"` where `boolean` expected → coerce to `true`/`false`
  4. number `9` where `string` expected → coerce to `"9"`
  5. enum case/whitespace drift (`"HIGH"`) → `.toLowerCase().trim()` (`"high"`)
  6. `null` in optional union → delete key

  Wired into `generateStructured` on every adapter. Each match avoids an LLM retry round-trip.

  Compatible with both Zod v3 (`invalid_enum_value`) and Zod v4 (`invalid_value`).

  20 new tests in `@llm-ports/core` (8 jsonrepair + 12 repair-validation).

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- f0885e6: Add image-content-block conformance tests to the shared contract suite. Closes a gap where a new adapter could ship with broken image handling and the conformance suite would still pass.

  The contract suite now includes two conditional tests under `image content blocks (conditional)`:
  1. `generateText accepts a base64 ImageBlock in the prompt`
  2. `generateText accepts a URL ImageBlock in the prompt`

  Each test gates on a new `ContractTestContext.imageContentSupport` flag:
  - `"base64"` — Ollama (URL form is not supported by the underlying API)
  - `"url"` — none today
  - `"base64+url"` — Anthropic, OpenAI
  - `"none"` / undefined — Vercel (v0.1 degrades images to placeholder strings)

  Each per-adapter `contract.test.ts` now declares its support level. Total contract-suite tests per adapter went from 8 to 10.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Minor Changes

- fbbd507: Fix: adapter forwards `temperature` to Claude models that reject it ([#12](https://github.com/baabakk/llm-ports/issues/12)).

  The adapter now learns at runtime when a model rejects `temperature` (Anthropic returns 400 "temperature is deprecated for this model" on newer reasoning Claude). On detection, the adapter strips the parameter, retries the call, and remembers the constraint for the rest of the process so subsequent calls skip the bad parameter.

  Five things ship together:
  - **Runtime learning + retry.** Single retry per call on `temperatureLocked` detection. Subsequent calls in the process apply the constraint up front.
  - **Static catalog.** `claude-opus-4-5` and `claude-sonnet-4-5` are pre-seeded so first-call discovery is skipped for these known cases. Extend by editing `KNOWN_TEMPERATURE_REJECTORS` in `src/capabilities.ts`.
  - **`onRetry` plumbing.** Brings adapter-anthropic to parity with adapter-openai and adapter-vercel. New `AnthropicAdapterOptions.onRetry` option. Fires with `reason: "capability-fallback", capability: "temperatureLocked"` on every learning retry.
  - **Click-to-file URL on first learning.** `console.warn` with a pre-filled GitHub New Issue URL the user can click to file a report. Maintainers see signal only when users take explicit action. No telemetry.
  - **SDK version compatibility warning.** Surfaces "upgrade us or downgrade them" when the installed `@anthropic-ai/sdk` is outside the tested range (`>=0.32.0 <0.50.0`).

  Also refactors the adapter to consume shared utilities from `@llm-ports/core` (no behavior change beyond the bug fix above; net deletion of ~150 lines of duplicated helpers).

  15 new tests (8 temperature-rejection + 7 SDK version check). All 29 existing tests still pass. Closes #12.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- Convert `ToolDefinition.inputSchema` (Zod) to real JSON Schema before sending to the provider. Both adapters previously passed `{ type: "object", properties: {} }` to the model, which meant the model had no idea what arguments a tool actually took — tool use was effectively broken when the agent had to infer field names. Adapters now wire `zod-to-json-schema` (`target: "openAi"` for the OpenAI adapter, default standard JSON Schema for Anthropic) with `$refStrategy: "none"` to inline references. Non-Zod inputs still fall back to the safe `{}` shape. Closes #1.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial alpha release.

  `llm-ports` is a TypeScript library implementing hexagonal-style ports & adapters for LLMs in production: multi-provider routing, USD-denominated cost gating, fallback chains, validation-failure recovery, and 7 capability factories (classify, score, draft, summarize, extract, plan, analyze).

  This alpha ships:
  - `@llm-ports/core` — `LLMPort` + `EmbeddingsPort` interfaces, `Registry` with task routing and fallback chains, USD cost computation with cache-discount support, in-memory budget + cost backends, `ContentBlock` discriminated union (text, image, audio, tool_use, tool_result), pluggable validation strategies, error class hierarchy.
  - `@llm-ports/capabilities` — 7 cognitive operation factories (`createClassifier`, `createScorer`, `createDrafter`, `createSummarizer`, `createExtractor`, `createPlanner`, `createAnalyzer`) with `onResult` / `onError` / `onBeforeCall` hooks, async resolver support for rubrics and personas.
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-anthropic` — direct `@anthropic-ai/sdk` adapter, prompt caching, vision, tool use.
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-openai` — OpenAI SDK adapter; `baseURL` covers 10+ OpenAI-compat providers (Azure, Groq, Together, Fireworks, DeepInfra, Perplexity, Cerebras, LiteLLM proxy). Runtime capability discovery (temperature locked, JSON mode, system message). Reasoning-model auto-recovery (OpenAI o-series + Cerebras gpt-oss). Transient-401 burst-protection retry for `sk-proj-*` keys.
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-ollama` — native Ollama adapter, model management (list/pull/delete/health), local-LLM workflows.
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-vercel` — bring-your-own-Vercel-models migration adapter; lets users on `@ai-sdk/*` adopt `llm-ports` plumbing without rewriting their SDK setup.

  Peer dependency: `zod >=3.24.0 <5`. Bring your own SDKs (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`, `ollama`, `ai`).

  Pre-launch test plan summary: 211 offline tests pass, 22 of 26 live API tests pass (with 4 documented model-flakiness items), latency p99 0.85ms vs 5ms target, 0 doc-rot signals across 111 doc snippets, fresh tarball install verified.
