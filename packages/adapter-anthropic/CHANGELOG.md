### Patch Changes

- c4e1825: Fix: `generateStructured` now accumulates token usage across `retry-with-feedback` rounds, so `result.usage` and `result.cost` reflect every SDK call, not just the final one.

  **The bug.** When `generateStructured` retried on a Zod-validation failure, `validationAttempts` correctly reported `2` (two real SDK calls happened), but `result.usage` was overwritten with only the SECOND call's tokens. Cost computation read from the overwritten usage, so the reported `result.cost.totalUSD` under-reported the truth by the cost of the first attempt. This was wrong in every retry path across all 5 adapters that implement `generateStructured`.

  ```ts
  // Before alpha.11:
  // 2 SDK calls. Call 1: 100 input / 25 output. Call 2: 150 input / 15 output.
  // Reported: { inputTokens: 150, outputTokens: 15, totalTokens: 165 }   ← only call 2

  // After alpha.11:
  // Reported: { inputTokens: 250, outputTokens: 40, totalTokens: 290 }   ← both calls
  ```

  **The fix.** All 5 generateStructured implementations now use `mergeTokenUsage(lastUsage, parseUsage(response))` inside the retry loop — the same pattern `runAgent` has used since alpha.0 to aggregate per-step usage. No public-API surface changed; the contract for `result.usage` is now "sum across all SDK calls", which is what callers always assumed.

  **Affected adapters:**
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-anthropic` (the original report site — Claude Haiku / Sonnet retry-with-feedback usage)
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-openai`
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-google`
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-ollama`
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-vercel`

  **Tests.** 3 new regression tests in `adapter-anthropic` covering: (a) first-attempt success reports just call 1, (b) retry success reports sum of both calls, (c) `result.cost.totalUSD` reflects the accumulated tokens. Same shape applies to the other 4 adapters; the runAgent paths already exercised `mergeTokenUsage` and continue to work.

  **Why this didn't show up in contract tests.** The shared contract suite asserts `result.validationAttempts >= 2` on the retry path but does not assert anything about cumulative usage — so the bug slipped through. Future addition.

  Closes a user report from 2026-05-26: `claude-haiku-4-5` and `claude-sonnet-4-5` calls were observed with `validationAttempts: 2` and ~832 total tokens (single-call-shaped), which the user correctly diagnosed as "the metric is meaningful but the usage field isn't summing".

## 0.1.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- a239d8c: Fix: `claude-opus-4-7` (and the rest of the Claude 4.5+ Opus / Sonnet family) now seeds `temperatureLocked: true` BEFORE the first call, preventing a wasted 400 round-trip on non-streaming methods and a HARD FAILURE on streaming methods.

  **Why this is more than cosmetic for streaming.** The non-streaming methods (`generateText`, `generateStructured`, `runAgent`) auto-retry on a temperature 400 via the in-adapter capability-fallback loop. The streaming methods (`streamText`, `streamStructured`) call `client.messages.stream` directly and cannot mid-stream retry — the catalog hit is the only mechanism that prevents `streamText({ temperature, model: "claude-opus-4-7", ... })` from hard-failing with `400 Bad Request: temperature is deprecated for this model.`.

  **What changed:**
  - `KNOWN_TEMPERATURE_REJECTORS` regexes broadened from `/^claude-opus-4-5/` + `/^claude-sonnet-4-5/` to `/^claude-opus-4-\d/` + `/^claude-sonnet-4-\d/`. Matches 4-5, 4-6, 4-7 (the new bug report), 4-8, 4-9, 4-N going forward, and dated aliases like `claude-opus-4-7-20251220`. Bare `claude-opus-4` (predates the deprecation) is intentionally NOT matched.
  - Bundled pricing entries for `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, and `claude-sonnet-4-6-20250514` now carry `capabilities: { temperatureLocked: true }` belt-and-suspenders.
  - Haiku 4-5 still accepts `temperature` and is not affected.

  12 new regression tests covering 7 temperature-locked model IDs + 4 still-accepts-temperature model IDs + 1 streaming-path test for `claude-opus-4-7`.

  Closes a bug observed in BEPA on 2026-05-26: a `streamText` against `claude-opus-4-7` failed with `400` because the catalog hadn't been extended past `4-5` when alpha.9 added the model to the pricing table.

## 0.1.0-alpha.9

### Minor Changes

- 286f132: Runtime model discovery: `LLMPort.listModels()` + `Registry.checkPricingFreshness()` (closes [#9](https://github.com/baabakk/llm-ports/issues/9)).

  **`LLMPort.listModels?(): Promise<ProviderModelInfo[]>`.** New optional method on every LLMPort. Returns the models the provider currently exposes via its catalog API. Implemented in:

  | Adapter             | Source                                                         | Pricing exposed?                                   |
  | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
  | `adapter-openai`    | `client.models.list()`                                         | No (just IDs + `owned_by`)                         |
  | `adapter-anthropic` | direct fetch to `/v1/models` (SDK <0.39 lacks `client.models`) | No                                                 |
  | `adapter-google`    | `client.models.list()` from `@google/genai`                    | No (Gemini surfaces context window, not USD rates) |
  | `adapter-ollama`    | `client.list()` (locally running models)                       | No (local; free)                                   |

  `adapter-vercel` does NOT implement it: the underlying `LanguageModel` is opaque per-provider and there's no uniform discovery surface.

  **`Registry.checkPricingFreshness()`.** Compares each adapter's bundled `*_PRICING` table against the provider's live catalog and reports:
  - `addedModels`: live IDs not in the bundled table (newly launched models you can opt into via `pricingOverrides`)
  - `removedModels`: bundled IDs the provider no longer exposes (likely deprecated)
  - `priceDrift`: per-model rate differences when the API surfaces pricing (today: none; future-proofs the report)
  - `skipped`: adapters without `listModels()` or whose call failed (with reason)

  Use in CI or a scheduled job to get a heads-up when a provider quietly changes its catalog. The bundled tables remain the source of truth for cost computation; this method does NOT auto-update them.

  ```ts
  const report = await registry.checkPricingFreshness();
  for (const a of report.checked) {
    if (a.addedModels.length > 0) {
      console.warn(`[${a.adapter}] new models available: ${a.addedModels.join(", ")}`);
    }
    if (a.removedModels.length > 0) {
      console.warn(
        `[${a.adapter}] bundled models no longer exposed: ${a.removedModels.join(", ")}`,
      );
    }
  }
  ```

  **New core exports:** `ProviderModelInfo`, `PricingFreshnessReport`, `PricingFreshnessAdapterReport`.

  4 new core tests for `checkPricingFreshness`.

### Patch Changes

- 286f132: Add `dangerouslyAllowBrowser?: boolean` option to `adapter-openai` and `adapter-anthropic` (closes [#32](https://github.com/baabakk/llm-ports/issues/32)).

  Both SDKs refuse to construct in a browser environment unless the flag is explicitly passed; the adapters now forward the option, unblocking BYO-key / proxy-token / trusted-internal-tool use cases. When the option is omitted (or `false`), the SDK constructor receives no `dangerouslyAllowBrowser` field — same as alpha.8 behavior, so server-side users see no change.

  `adapter-vercel` gets a README note pointing users at the `@ai-sdk/*` LanguageModel construction site, where the equivalent flag lives in that adapter's architecture.

  `adapter-google` and `adapter-ollama` are not affected: `@google/genai` runs in browsers by design; `adapter-ollama` is local-daemon and the browser concern is CORS at the daemon, not an SDK flag.

  5 new unit tests (3 for adapter-openai, 2 for adapter-anthropic).

## 0.1.0-alpha.8

### Patch Changes

- 6b6f139: Docs polish across all 5 adapter READMEs (closes [#7](https://github.com/baabakk/llm-ports/issues/7)). Every adapter README now follows the canonical section template:

  ```
  # @llm-ports/adapter-<name>
  <tagline>

  ## Install
  ## Configure
  ## Adapter options
  ## Bundled pricing
  ## Supported features
  ## Content blocks supported
  ## Cancellation
  <adapter-specific sections>
  ## Reading next
  ```

  Adapter-specific sections (Anthropic's temperature handling, OpenAI's compat-providers + known reasoning models, Ollama's local-to-cloud flip + model management, Google's "why over OpenAI-compat baseURL", Vercel's "when to use vs direct") sit between Cancellation and Reading next. Public-facing behavior unchanged.

  Per-example `.env.example` files added to all 10 examples (closes [#8](https://github.com/baabakk/llm-ports/issues/8)) so new users can `cp .env.example .env` then fill in their keys without grepping the source for `process.env.*`.

  No code changes; package version bumps via this changeset because the README is published to npm as the package landing page.

## 0.1.0-alpha.7

### Patch Changes

- c805169: Two registry-surface improvements that close long-standing v0.1 gaps:

  **Registry runtime fallback** — the registry now walks the task's fallback chain on errors matching a configurable predicate. Previously the chain was walked ONLY on budget gating; runtime errors (5xx, network failures, transient outages wrapped as `ProviderUnavailableError`) failed the call instead of trying the next provider. This was the largest functional gap in v0.1 per the status doc.

  ```ts
  const registry = createRegistryFromEnv({
    adapters: {
      /* ... */
    },
    // runtimeFallback: "default", // walks on ProviderUnavailableError (the default)
    // runtimeFallback: "none",    // disables; preserves v0.1 behavior
    // runtimeFallback: { shouldFallback: (err) => err instanceof MyCustomError }, // custom
  });
  ```

  Cost recording happens ONLY on the successful provider. The chain walk respects per-provider budget gates — if `fast` is over budget AND fails, the registry walks to `backup`. Streaming methods walk only on synchronous stream-creation failure (not mid-iteration), since switching providers mid-stream would emit a confusing mix.

  **`forceProviderAlias` per-call option** (closes [#15](https://github.com/baabakk/llm-ports/issues/15)) — every `*Options` interface gains `forceProviderAlias?: string`. Setting it routes directly to the named provider, bypassing the `LLM_TASK_ROUTE_*` lookup. Per-provider budget gates still apply (so you can't bypass a hard cap); runtime fallback does NOT engage (caller explicitly picked this provider, falling back would defeat the point). Useful for toolbars where the operator picks the model, or for one-off "use the expensive model for this single call" patterns.

  ```ts
  await llm.generateText({
    taskType: "describe",
    prompt: "...",
    forceProviderAlias: userSelectedProvider, // bypasses task routing
  });
  ```

  **New exports** from `@llm-ports/core`: `Registry.selectByAlias()`, `Registry.selectViableChain()`, `Registry.shouldFallback`.

  **Adapter patch bumps**: no code change — adapters pick up the new `forceProviderAlias` field on `*Options` automatically via core's peer-dep type re-export.

  13 new tests (8 runtime-fallback + 5 forceProviderAlias). The `registry-edges.test.ts` test that documented "runtime ProviderUnavailableError propagates and does NOT trigger fallback (TD-LLMP-09)" has been inverted to assert the new behavior.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- 34cd6cd: Add `signal?: AbortSignal` to all 5 `*Options` interfaces (closes [#24](https://github.com/baabakk/llm-ports/issues/24)).

  Previously the only abort mechanism was a consumer-side `Promise.race` against a timeout, which stops awaiting the promise but doesn't actually cancel the in-flight HTTP request — the LLM call keeps running and bills tokens. With `signal` threaded through to the provider SDK, `controller.abort()` now cancels the in-flight fetch.

  ```ts
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const promise = llm.generateText({
    taskType: "screen_analyze",
    prompt: [...],
    signal: controller.signal,
  });
  // User clicks cancel:
  controller.abort();
  // promise rejects with signal.reason; the HTTP request to the provider is cancelled.
  ```

  **Per-adapter behavior (declared via contract suite's new `signalSupport` flag):**

  | Adapter                        | `signalSupport`    | What it does                                                                                                                                                                              |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@llm-ports/adapter-openai`    | `"entry+inflight"` | Entry-time check + signal threaded as 2nd-arg request options on `client.chat.completions.create`                                                                                         |
  | `@llm-ports/adapter-anthropic` | `"entry+inflight"` | Entry-time check + signal threaded into `client.messages.create` (non-streaming) AND `client.messages.stream`                                                                             |
  | `@llm-ports/adapter-google`    | `"entry+inflight"` | Entry-time check + signal threaded into `client.models.generateContent` config                                                                                                            |
  | `@llm-ports/adapter-vercel`    | `"entry+inflight"` | Entry-time check + Vercel's `abortSignal` field on `generateText` / `streamText`                                                                                                          |
  | `@llm-ports/adapter-ollama`    | `"entry-only"`     | Entry-time check only. ollama-js SDK doesn't expose a per-call signal yet — only a coarse `client.abort()` that cancels all in-flight requests on the client. Tracking upstream for v0.7+ |

  **New core export:** `throwIfAborted(signal)` helper. Honors `signal.reason` (modern AbortController convention); falls back to a generic `DOMException("AbortError")`.

  **New contract test capability:** `ContractTestContext.signalSupport: "none" | "entry-only" | "entry+inflight"`. Adapters declare their support level; the conformance suite runs entry-time abort tests against `generateText`, `generateStructured`, and `runAgent` for any adapter that declares `"entry-only"` or higher.

  **`runAgent` extra:** all 5 adapters' agent loops re-check `throwIfAborted(options.signal)` between steps so cancellation mid-loop propagates (not just at the entry point).

  Public API additive only. Existing call sites that omit `signal` are unchanged.

  21 new tests (6 unit + 3 contract × 5 adapters).

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- b00ff65: Image-block boundary validation (closes issues #19, #20, #21 from the image-pipeline audit).

  **New errors** in `@llm-ports/core`:
  - `ImageTooLargeError(alias, imageIndex, byteSize, limitBytes)` — base64 image exceeds the provider's per-image byte limit
  - `InvalidImageUrlError(alias, url, reason)` — URL-form image with `file://`, `data:`, missing scheme, or other bad shape

  **New helpers** in `@llm-ports/core`:
  - `validateImageBlocks(blocks, opts)` — call at the adapter boundary on every outgoing `ContentBlock[]`
  - `validateImageUrl(url, alias, allowFileUrl)` — standalone URL-shape check

  **Per-adapter boundary checks** wired in every port method (`generateText`, `generateStructured`, `streamText`, `streamStructured`, `runAgent`) with adapter-specific defaults:

  | Adapter             | Default `imageSizeLimitBytes` | Source                                  |
  | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | `adapter-anthropic` | 5 MB                          | Anthropic's documented per-image limit  |
  | `adapter-openai`    | 20 MB                         | OpenAI's documented per-image limit     |
  | `adapter-ollama`    | unset (model-dependent)       | Ollama itself doesn't enforce           |
  | `adapter-vercel`    | 20 MB                         | Matches the underlying SDK's image path |
  | `adapter-google`    | 20 MB (new package)           | Gemini's documented inline limit        |

  **Assistant `image_url` decoding** in `adapter-openai`: `fromOpenAIAssistantMessage` now decodes any `image_url` content part in an assistant response back to an `ImageBlock` (data URI → base64, http(s) → URL). Previously these were silently dropped (commented "very rare"). Zero models emit this today, but future-proofs the round-trip.

  17 new tests in `@llm-ports/core` + 3 new tests in `@llm-ports/adapter-openai`.

### Patch Changes

- b00ff65: Two-layer validation hardening that reduces retry-with-feedback round-trips:

  **Layer 1 — `extractJSON()` falls back to `jsonrepair`** when plain `JSON.parse` fails. Catches trailing commas, single quotes, smart quotes, unquoted keys, Python `None`/`True`/`False`, comments, missing braces, and most other LLM syntactic quirks before paying for a retry. Gated on "input has `{` or `[`" so prose-only input still throws cleanly.

  **Layer 2 — `attemptValidationRepair()` ported from BEPA** runs between Zod `safeParse` failure and the retry-with-feedback step. Deterministic, schema-driven repair of 6 patterns:
  1. `null` where a non-null type is expected → delete key (lets `.optional()` succeed)
  2. string `"9"` where `number` expected → coerce to `9`
  3. string `"true"`/`"false"` where `boolean` expected → coerce to `true`/`false`
  4. number `9` where `string` expected → coerce to `"9"`
  5. enum case/whitespace drift (`"HIGH"`) → `.toLowerCase().trim()` (`"high"`)
  6. `null` in optional union → delete key

  Wired into `generateStructured` on every adapter. Each match avoids an LLM retry round-trip.

  Compatible with both Zod v3 (`invalid_enum_value`) and Zod v4 (`invalid_value`).

  20 new tests in `@llm-ports/core` (8 jsonrepair + 12 repair-validation).

### Patch Changes

- f0885e6: Add image-content-block conformance tests to the shared contract suite. Closes a gap where a new adapter could ship with broken image handling and the conformance suite would still pass.

  The contract suite now includes two conditional tests under `image content blocks (conditional)`:
  1. `generateText accepts a base64 ImageBlock in the prompt`
  2. `generateText accepts a URL ImageBlock in the prompt`

  Each test gates on a new `ContractTestContext.imageContentSupport` flag:
  - `"base64"` — Ollama (URL form is not supported by the underlying API)
  - `"url"` — none today
  - `"base64+url"` — Anthropic, OpenAI
  - `"none"` / undefined — Vercel (v0.1 degrades images to placeholder strings)

  Each per-adapter `contract.test.ts` now declares its support level. Total contract-suite tests per adapter went from 8 to 10.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Minor Changes

- fbbd507: Fix: adapter forwards `temperature` to Claude models that reject it ([#12](https://github.com/baabakk/llm-ports/issues/12)).

  The adapter now learns at runtime when a model rejects `temperature` (Anthropic returns 400 "temperature is deprecated for this model" on newer reasoning Claude). On detection, the adapter strips the parameter, retries the call, and remembers the constraint for the rest of the process so subsequent calls skip the bad parameter.

  Five things ship together:
  - **Runtime learning + retry.** Single retry per call on `temperatureLocked` detection. Subsequent calls in the process apply the constraint up front.
  - **Static catalog.** `claude-opus-4-5` and `claude-sonnet-4-5` are pre-seeded so first-call discovery is skipped for these known cases. Extend by editing `KNOWN_TEMPERATURE_REJECTORS` in `src/capabilities.ts`.
  - **`onRetry` plumbing.** Brings adapter-anthropic to parity with adapter-openai and adapter-vercel. New `AnthropicAdapterOptions.onRetry` option. Fires with `reason: "capability-fallback", capability: "temperatureLocked"` on every learning retry.
  - **Click-to-file URL on first learning.** `console.warn` with a pre-filled GitHub New Issue URL the user can click to file a report. Maintainers see signal only when users take explicit action. No telemetry.
  - **SDK version compatibility warning.** Surfaces "upgrade us or downgrade them" when the installed `@anthropic-ai/sdk` is outside the tested range (`>=0.32.0 <0.50.0`).

  Also refactors the adapter to consume shared utilities from `@llm-ports/core` (no behavior change beyond the bug fix above; net deletion of ~150 lines of duplicated helpers).

  15 new tests (8 temperature-rejection + 7 SDK version check). All 29 existing tests still pass. Closes #12.

### Patch Changes

- Convert `ToolDefinition.inputSchema` (Zod) to real JSON Schema before sending to the provider. Both adapters previously passed `{ type: "object", properties: {} }` to the model, which meant the model had no idea what arguments a tool actually took — tool use was effectively broken when the agent had to infer field names. Adapters now wire `zod-to-json-schema` (`target: "openAi"` for the OpenAI adapter, default standard JSON Schema for Anthropic) with `$refStrategy: "none"` to inline references. Non-Zod inputs still fall back to the safe `{}` shape. Closes #1.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial alpha release.

  `llm-ports` is a TypeScript library implementing hexagonal-style ports & adapters for LLMs in production: multi-provider routing, USD-denominated cost gating, fallback chains, validation-failure recovery, and 7 capability factories (classify, score, draft, summarize, extract, plan, analyze).

  This alpha ships:
  - `@llm-ports/core` — `LLMPort` + `EmbeddingsPort` interfaces, `Registry` with task routing and fallback chains, USD cost computation with cache-discount support, in-memory budget + cost backends, `ContentBlock` discriminated union (text, image, audio, tool_use, tool_result), pluggable validation strategies, error class hierarchy.
  - `@llm-ports/capabilities` — 7 cognitive operation factories (`createClassifier`, `createScorer`, `createDrafter`, `createSummarizer`, `createExtractor`, `createPlanner`, `createAnalyzer`) with `onResult` / `onError` / `onBeforeCall` hooks, async resolver support for rubrics and personas.
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-anthropic` — direct `@anthropic-ai/sdk` adapter, prompt caching, vision, tool use.
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-openai` — OpenAI SDK adapter; `baseURL` covers 10+ OpenAI-compat providers (Azure, Groq, Together, Fireworks, DeepInfra, Perplexity, Cerebras, LiteLLM proxy). Runtime capability discovery (temperature locked, JSON mode, system message). Reasoning-model auto-recovery (OpenAI o-series + Cerebras gpt-oss). Transient-401 burst-protection retry for `sk-proj-*` keys.
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-ollama` — native Ollama adapter, model management (list/pull/delete/health), local-LLM workflows.
  - `@llm-ports/adapter-vercel` — bring-your-own-Vercel-models migration adapter; lets users on `@ai-sdk/*` adopt `llm-ports` plumbing without rewriting their SDK setup.

  Peer dependency: `zod >=3.24.0 <5`. Bring your own SDKs (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`, `ollama`, `ai`).

  Pre-launch test plan summary: 211 offline tests pass, 22 of 26 live API tests pass (with 4 documented model-flakiness items), latency p99 0.85ms vs 5ms target, 0 doc-rot signals across 111 doc snippets, fresh tarball install verified.
